        <h1>My Favorite City: Seattle</h1>
    </div>
 <p>My favorite city is Seattle, Washington. I'm very much a homebody and don't travel often, but whenever I do, I find myself longing for the comfort, culture, and familiarity of my hometown. Seattle is the largest city in Washington, home to about 750,000 people. It’s surrounded by water, mountains, and evergreen forests, giving it a unique mix of city life and outdoor adventure. The weather is famous for being unpredictable with long months of dreary gray rainy days and the occasional surprise sunshine. I do absolutely love the rain. </p>
